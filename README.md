AES only supports one encrypted key of the right size of the different bytes: 16, 24, 32, 128, 256 bytes.

This can be placed in ".properties" files or in "DB" files, the latter option is more secure, and also allows you to encrypt the specified column in MySQL.
Important: AES supports only exact keys of the specified size which can be made up of, I repeat, exactly 16, 24, 32, 128 and up to 256 bytes.

In this file as written, it is 32 bytes. ENCRYPT_KEY (No reference to the user's personal key).
